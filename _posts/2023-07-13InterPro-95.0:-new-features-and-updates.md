This release includes new features and improvements to the InterPro website. The list of changes is detailed below. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please [contact us](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/interpro).

# Content
In this release, we have updated NCBIfam to version 12.0 and updated InterPro entries accordingly.
We also have integrated 424 new signatures from the NCBIfam (259), Pfam (2), PANTHER (5), CDD (157), SFLD (1) databases.

## New resources
### DisProt
[DisProt](https://www.disprot.org/) is a database of intrinsically disordered proteins, where disordered regions are manually curated from the literature.
We are providing Disprot annotations in InterPro, these annotations can be seen in the External Sources track in the protein sequence viewer when looking at a protein page.

### RepeatsDB
[RepeatsDB](https://repeatsdb.bio.unipd.it/) is a database of annotated tandem repeat protein structures. We are providing RepeatsDB annotations in InterPro, these annotations can be seen in the External Sources track in the protein sequence viewer when looking at a protein page.

### ELM
The Eukaryotic Linear Motif ([ELM](http://elm.eu.org/)) resource focuses on annotation and detection of eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) by providing both a repository of annotated motif data and an exploratory tool for motif prediction. ELMs, or short linear motifs (SLiMs), are compact protein interaction sites composed of short stretches of adjacent amino acids. They are enriched in intrinsically disordered regions of the proteome and provide a wide range of functionality to proteins. They play crucial roles in cell regulation and are also of clinical importance, as aberrant SLiM function has been associated with several diseases and SLiM mimics are often used by pathogens to manipulate their hosts' cellular machinery ([Davey, 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21146412), [Uyar, 2014](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25057855)).
We are now providing ELM annotations in InterPro. When a protein has an ELM annotation, it can be found in the Other Features track of the protein sequence viewer.
